## About Me
My background is in computer science, both as a student and as an educator. Before starting my PhD, I worked as a lecturer and assistant lecturer at Dilla University in Ethiopia, where I taught undergraduate courses such as Artificial Intelligence, Data Mining, and Programming. In addition to teaching, I served as a coordinator at the university’s STEM Centre, where I helped lead initiatives to promote science, technology, engineering, and mathematics education. These experiences shaped my interest in applied, human-centered AI, particularly in how AI systems can support real-world decision-making in complex domains like healthcare. 

## Academic Background
I hold a Master’s degree in Computer Science with a specialization in Data and Web Engineering. I also earned my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science. These academic foundations have equipped me with strong technical and analytical skills, particularly in the areas of intelligent systems, software development, and data-driven technologies.

## Research Interest
My research focuses on the design of responsible and trustworthy AI systems for clinical decision support, with a particular interest in how cognitive biases affect both human and machine decision-making in healthcare. Diagnostic errors remain a significant problem in clinical settings, often driven by cognitive biases, mental shortcuts that can lead to incorrect or delayed diagnoses. While AI systems are increasingly being used to support clinicians, they are often trained on historical data generated by human decisions. As a result, these systems risk inheriting and even amplifying the same reasoning error they aim to address.

My goal is to explore how we can detect and mitigate cognitive bias in AI systems, ensuring they align more closely with clinical reasoning and support better decision-making. My research will be guided by the following key questions:
  1. How do different types of cognitive bias manifest in clinical decision-making?
  2. What techniques can help identify when clinical data or decisions are influenced by bias?
  3. How can we design AI systems that reduce the risk of cognitive bias while remaining accurate, interpretable, and trustworthy?

To address these questions, I will investigate methods for identifying bias in real-world healthcare data and models, assess existing tools for fairness and transparency, and propose design strategies that account for cognitive bias. The ultimate aim is to support the development of AI systems that are not only technically robust but also ethically and clinically aligned, helping to improve patient outcomes while reducing unintended risks.
